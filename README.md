# Voyago

## 📝 Overview
**Voyago** is a backend system that aggregates multiple external APIs to evaluate travel risk for a given destination and date.

The system performs:
* **Geolocation lookup**
* **Weather forecast analysis**
* **Air quality evaluation**
* **Public holiday impact detection**
* **News-based situational risk assessment**

It computes a **deterministic risk score** and provides structured insights via RESTful endpoints.

## 🏗️ Architecture (Phase 1)
* **FastAPI** (REST API layer)
* **Async external API orchestration**
* **MongoDB** (persistent storage)
* **Redis** (caching layer)
* **Security:** API key authentication & Rate limiting middleware

---

## 🎯 Goals
* Implement layered backend architecture.
* Practice API aggregation and orchestration.
* Apply deterministic scoring logic.
* Follow professional Git workflow.
